# site-bookmark-plugin
Just a placeholder for a chrome plugin I want to build

Open a site you visit regularly, see a list of bookmarks for parts of the site you'd like to keep coming back. Add bookmarks or remove easily. Only see bookmarks on a per-domain basis.

Example: bookmarks to all your favorite repos on github always available on the right, or something.
